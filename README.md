 In 2018, 260 million children weren't attending school. At the same time, more than half of these young students didn't meet minimum reading and math standards. Education was already in a tough place when COVID-19 forced most countries to temporarily close schools. This further delayed learning opportunities and intellectual development. The equity gaps in every country could grow wider. We need to re-think the current education system in terms of attendance, engagement, and individualized attention.  Riiid Labs, an AI solutions provider delivering creative disruption to the education market, empowers global education players to rethink traditional ways of learning leveraging AI. With a strong belief in equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million South Korean students.
